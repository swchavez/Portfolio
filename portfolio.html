      Here are a couple of videos I created. From compiling video, editing, creating script, and putting the finished project together. I also created the targeted ad group to boost the campaign videos!

        <p>Using Twitter API and collecting twitter data, I worked with a partner to collect twitter data and AWS EMR.
          We searched tweets associated with the 2018 MLB World Series to see if Tweet frequency could be used to predict
          the winner of the 2018 World Series. We examined the data to confirm its value for analysis and then used Jupyter
          notebooks, Tableau, sentiment analysis, NLP techniques, and multiple other techniques/strategies to create a PowerPoint presentation and video for the class.</p>
