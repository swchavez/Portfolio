      <h3>My Tennis Journey</h3>
      <p>While other sports never quite clicked, I discovered a love for tennis after stumbling upon a free trial of the Tennis Channel. It sparked a passion that led me to playing, watching, teaching, and falling in love with the sport. I found a racquet at the local thrift store and played every day just hitting the ball in the yard from the techniques I learned from TV. Finally, my parents decided to sign me up for group clinic through the city's park and rec department. Though we never had the money for many lessons, my parents saw my passion for the sport and decided to make as much of a sacrifice as they could! </p>
      <p>Despite the initial learning curve, my coaches saw potential in me. Constantly offering to give me free lessons and work with me off schedule and with amazing friends that allowed me to tag along with their private lessons, falling in love with the sport became a reality. With their guidance and my dedication, I achieved many accomplishments through the sport on and off the court! My goal is to use the sport as a means of pursuing life, making connections, and helping others the way others have helped me.</p>

      <h3>Sharing the Love</h3>
      <p>My passion extends beyond playing. For years, I've enjoyed giving back by teaching private lessons and co-leading summer camps at prestigious clubs like Tunica National and Hernando Hills Country Club.</p>
      <p>My goal is to not only help students develop their tennis skills but also foster personal growth off the court.</p>
