        <p> Welcome to my page! My name is Stephen Chavez. I am a young professional living in Oxford, Mississippi. I have a passion for dreaming big, helping others, and meeting everyone where they are with a high quality of geniune friendship. I graduated Cum Laude at the University of Mississippi in 2018 and then graduated with my M.B.A. Summa Cum Laude at the University of Memphis in 2021.
        </p>
        <p> I received my B.A. in Public Policy Leadership and began the life of campaign management. Shortly after serving a national political party in Houston, Texas and in Mississippi, I quickly became intrigued with the technical aspect of campaigns which led me to multiple campaign cycles as Data Director. I served as a Data Director for statewide campaigns in Mississippi and in West Virginia and also did technical campaign work in Baton Rouge, Lousianna. Due to my success as a data director, I then served as campaign manager on multiple campaigns. 
        </p>
      <p>
            I quicly realized how much I enjoyed certain things such as reporting, documenting, and analytics so much so that I went to get my MBA and focused the analytical side of things.
            Since, I have began a new career path in tech starting as a Systems Analyst at DHL Supply Chain, then as a Professional Business systems analyst at Corelogic. I have since progressed into a role in Product Management serving as the Product Owner for a tier 3 dev ops client experience team for multiple appraisal vendor management softwares and collateral quality control solutions.
            I am looking at to continue pursuing my goals, growing my knowledge, and dreaming big.
        </p>
