        <p> Welcome to my page! My name is Stephen Chavez. I am a young professional living in Oxford, Mississippi. I have a passion for dreaming big, helping others, and meeting everyone where they are with a high quality of geniune friendship. I graduated Cum Laude at the University of Mississippi in 2018 and then graduated with my M.B.A. Summa Cum Laude at the University of Memphis in 2021.
        </p>
        <p> Although I find myself loving to learn and challenge myself professionally, what really drives my life is my faith in Jesus Christ and God, my sweet wife Mary Kathryn, and my pup Moose, and all of our friends and family! I love hanging out with friends, playing any and all sports, watching movies in order to analyze them, and mostly just being outside and enjoying the wonderful gifts we've been given!
        </p>
        <p> I received my B.A. in Public Policy Leadership and began the life of campaign management. Shortly after serving a national political party in Houston, Texas and in Mississippi, I quickly became intrigued with the technical aspect of campaigns which led me to multiple campaign cycles as Data Director. I served as a Data Director for statewide campaigns in Mississippi and in West Virginia and also did technical campaign work in Baton Rouge, Lousianna. Due to my success as a data director, I then served as campaign manager on multiple campaigns. 
        </p>
      <p>
            I quickly realized how much I enjoyed certain things such as reporting, documenting, and analytics so much so that I went to get my MBA with a focus in web analytics.
            Since my sudden career shift from Politics to Tech, I have had the pleasure of working in Memphis, TN at DHL Supply Chain as a Systems Analyst, then as a Business Systems Analyst at CoreLogic. Once begining at CoreLogic, I found myself overly interested in the Financial Tech space in which the company operates. I quickly realized my passion derived in driving change and being a leader of development so I sought out and progressed into a role of Product Management. In this role, I serve as the Product Owner for a tier 3 dev ops client experience team for multiple appraisal order management softwares and collateral qualtiy control solutions. 
            I am looking to continue pursuing my goals, growing my skills/knowledge, and always dreaming big!
