     <p>
        Since childhood, my passion for tennis has been unwavering. Whether playing on the court, watching matches unfold, or engaging in discussions about the sport, tennis has always been a significant part of my life.  So, you can imagine my excitement when I learned about a book that uses tennis as a metaphor to impart lessons applicable in both our professional careers and personal lives. "The Inner Game of Tennis: The Classic Guide to the Mental Side of Peak Performance" by W. Timothy Gallwey promised to unveil strategies for enhancing focus, awareness, and performance under pressure, among other valuable skills. I'm thrilled to share that the book surpassed my expectations. Its insights were not only enlightening but also immediately actionable, offering guidance that I could apply both on and off the court. As I reflect on the lessons gleaned from its pages, it's evident that they will continue to shape my approach to tennis and life alike. To learn more about my insights, read on!
      </p>
      <p>
        In the dynamic realm of sports and life, a fascinating interplay exists between the challenges we face externally and the battles we wage within ourselves. Imagine a tennis court where the clash of racquets and the swish of balls serve as echoes of a deeper competition – the battle of the mind. It's within this arena that W. Timothy Gallwey's masterpiece, "The Inner Game of Tennis," comes to life, uncovering strategies that stretch far beyond the boundaries of tennis and extend their reach into both our personal and professional spheres. This book introduces the idea that unlocking peak performance does not solely hinge on refining physical skills; it's about mastering the "inner game." As we embark on this exploration, we'll uncover the wisdom within these pages and discover how a game played on the court becomes a metaphor for excelling in the fast-paced game of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fully grasp the profound impact of "The Inner Game of Tennis," we must seize one of Timothy's early lessons: visualizing the desired outcome. Rather than allowing the inner voice to dictate every move, a more effective approach is to close your eyes and mentally envision precisely how you want events to unfold. Gallwey's insight encapsulates this: "If we let ourselves lose touch with our ability to feel our actions, by relying too heavily on instructions, we can seriously compromise our access to our natural learning processes and our potential to perform." This underscores the importance of relying on the instincts of our intuitive self (Self 2) to reinforce the neural pathways to optimal outcomes. This very principle lays the foundation for our journey through "The Inner Game of Tennis." Consider the intensity, focus, and split-second decisions demanded of a tennis player on the court. Now expand this canvas beyond the match, intertwining these strategies with personal and professional pursuits. If you're curious about how lessons from a tennis book can guide us in mastering mental challenges across various facets of life, continue on. In the following sections, we'll dive into the teachings that unlock the secrets to elevating our performance both on and off the metaphorical court.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first lesson introduced is the differentiating between the internal battle. The first person you face before you step on the court or before you even get out of bed. This may seem obvious but when you implement the tennis analogy as well as the imagery strategy, this example becomes much more clear. We have all heard this example before, the internal conflict, the devil and angel on our shoulder, etc. However, Timothy explains this internal conflict as Self 1 and Self 2. At its core, Self 1 represents the mental consciousness that incessantly instructs what one should be doing, while Self 2 embodies the physical self that executes the actions. Self 1, the analytical mind, tends to overanalyze, criticize, and interfere with performance, whereas Self 2's role entails natural, effortless performance when granted control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Differentiating between self 1 and self 2 has many benefits. However, one main benefit in separating these two selves would be the ability to focus, stay in the present, and remain relaxed and concentrated. Avoiding the back and forth argument between yourself will allow you to focus on the challenge ahead with nothing holding you back or second guessing your moves. A lesson taught that I found interesting and oftentimes find myself doing the opposite of is wishing for your opponent to mess up. We have all found ourselves wishing for a break and putting extra thought on the idea of someone else’s mistake benefiting you. However, Timothy’s suggestion was to hope your opponent hits that serve in. This will increase your preparedness and allow you the ability to practice that extra shot. Although it may not actually be practice, in the situation of matchplay, if we have that mindset that even gametime decisions are practice then pressure is released. We will also then tend to imagine ourselves taking the victory, finding a way to win and not wishing for someone else’s mistakes handing you the win. A common example of this is when returning serve. I often find myself wishing the opponent will double fault and hand me a free point. The issue here is that I am then half expecting the serve to go into the net or go long so I am at a disadvantage of being unprepared when that does not happen. If instead I am focusing on my return of serve then I am already preparing myself to begin the point and strategizing what I can control. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Building upon this idea of getting extra practice in and not wishing or expecting mess up’s to benefit you is one of the most crucial lessons the book touches upon that might truly be the most difficult to capture. It is the idea of winning through losing and embracing setbacks. This topic can easily resonate with anyone and definitely does for me. One situation that I constantly go back to is when I was laid off from a new job that I moved to a new city for a month before my wedding. While there is never a good time for bad news, this was even more inconvenient and stressful. While it would have been easy to roll over, give up, turn in my keys and write everyone at the company off, that was never an option for me. Instead of being salty and burning bridges, I embraced the setback. I looked at this as an opportunity to aggressively network with no shame and to use every resource I had. I set up conversations with executives with the company including the CIO. I spoke to everyone I could, not as a means to gain anything but rather to learn. My motivation was not setting up meetings to ask for a job but rather to listen about their work and accomplishments. Their take on industry matters, what is going well or what are areas of weakness. Two weeks later I had multiple job offers on the table to choose from all of which were promotions with significant salary increases from the same company. While I was blessed, beyond lucky, and receiving grace from God that I did not deserve, the main action taken was being willing to find victory in losing and embracing the setback by looking for adjacent opportunities. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After introducing Self 1 and Self 2, Timothy sums the goal of realizing the relationship between the two “harmony between the two selves exists when this mind is quiet and focused. Only then can peak performance be reached.” However, I think the true explanation of the goal between harmony is best described when Timothy writes, “great music and art are said to arise from the quiet depths of the unconscious, and true expressions of love are said to come from a source which lies beneath words and thoughts.” That might be the most beautiful way of saying shut up your mind and just do it! You might think, well in my normal days I don’t do so much music/art making or expressing my love is easier said than done. Which if you are thinking that then you have just realized the sneakiness of Self 2! Acknowledge it and work on quieting Self 2 by going straight into action and stopping all the thinking. There is one point of imagery Timothy gives us of a cat stalking its prey. How focused the cat is and attentive in every step. It is pretty obvious that the cat has peak tunnel vision at this moment, it is not weighted down with all the thoughts of what could happen, what has happened, what will happen. The cat is not focused on the fact that if he does not catch the prey then dinner might not be an option. No, the cat knows its goal and is stuck on what he needs to do without a mere thought of the consequences if he fails. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is obvious that we need to stay focused but it is not easy and is especially difficult to know what to do when we begin to lose focus. Well for starters one tip Timothy gives is to let go of our inclination to view everything that happens as good or bad. This is the basic principle of the Inner Game. Instead of being mad or happy when an outcome occurs we can switch this mindset by using descriptive words or explaining the reality of what is happening instead of using judgemental words to describe the events around you. Another useful analogy Timothy Uses, “when we plant a rose seed in the earth, we notice that it is small, but we do not criticize it as ‘rootless and stemless’ we treat it as a seed, giving it the water and nourishment required of a seed. When it first shoots up out of the earth, we can't condemn it as immature and underdeveloped. The rose is a rose from the time it is a seed to the time it dies. Within it, at all times, it contains its whole potential. It seems to be constantly in the process of change’ yet at each state, at each moment, it is perfectly all right as it is.” You may have heard this rose analogy before and think that while it is a great example, I am not a rose and I would not judge a baby on its ability to do adult tasks. But Timothy also provides an on court example which is more so easily applied to real life examples. He explains that when playing tennis and you hit a ball out, a majority of people will describe that as bad, be mad, and demand themselves to hit the ball in. The correct, Inner Game, approach would be to notice how far the ball went out and end the judgment of “bad” with descriptive facts. Dig a little deeper and get analytical in ways such as, I keep hitting my forehand about 2 inches out when I am trying to go cross court. This will help the mind calm down by thinking more specifically and things will become undistorted as we begin to unlearn judgment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One actionable example Timothy gives is to imagine that you are on camera. That you are the greatest tennis player ever (Coco Gauff or Tommy Paul) and there is a documentary being created on your greatness. After every shot, every task, imagine that you just hit the most amazing and beautiful competitive shot the world has ever seen. Do not focus on the camera panning the shot over to the shot or your opponent but rather imagine that the camera kept its focus on you. How would you imagine your mannerism to be after the shot. Whether you miss the shot or not imagine that camera only knows how well you do based on how you hold yourself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Changing habits and forgetting current habits is difficult. Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could go back as children with our current knowledge and relearn everything for the first time and avoid all the bad habits we have picked up before they became routine. Well, while that is not possible, it is possible to start new patterns “with childlike disregard for imagined difficulties.” Isn’t that the main reason we never pick up a new habit or start something new. We are always imagining the difficulties. Children are often so quick to disregard all preconceived notions of difficulty or fear and that is the goal we should all strive for going forward. One way to achieve childlike disregard is to not focus on changing anything but watch the change come naturally by experiencing what is happening, “don’t intellectualize it. See what it feels like to ask yourself to do something and let it happen without any conscious trying.” 
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of fighting all of these bad habits we need to focus on the action, let go and get going. A visualization Timothy gives is that we cannot just focus the mind by ditching it, we have to put it somewhere. That somewhere is focus! In order to achieve that focus the simplest tennis example is watching the ball. It is one of the first lessons a tennis player learns, to watch the ball. Simple task but not so easy. When we are told to watch the seams we start to focus in. We then begin to benefit from more than just actually seeing the ball but also noticing the spin and direction of the ball as well. I never really understood the line in the Patriot “aim small, miss small” until I read this example. We know we need to focus/watch the ball but it is a bit too vague. Instead, the idea of focusing on the seams or the lettering on the ball is a focused enough target that when aiming there you will not miss by much. The Inner Game goal is to focus on being relaxed, not tense and not overly controlled. One interesting pointer Timothy gives is listening to the ball bounce. This sounded super odd to me but when I put it into practice, I understand my focus improving tremendously. Additionally, I remember watching The Great British Baking Show and one of the contestants would listen to his bakes. While I am not entirely sure if this actually helped him or not, it was obvious that the unorthodox ways of focusing sometimes present the most impactful results as we begin to learn new habits through new means. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In closing, "The Inner Game of Tennis" has illuminated the path to peak performance on and off the court, offering invaluable insights into mastering the inner game of the mind. Through the exploration of Self 1 and Self 2, the cultivation of focus, and the embrace of setbacks as opportunities for growth, we've gained a deeper understanding of how to excel in the game of life. While we've touched upon key lessons in this journey, the book contains a wealth of wisdom waiting to be uncovered. While there are plenty of lessons learned that I did not touch on such as relaxed concentration, non judgemental observation/awareness, using feedback to make adjustments, growth mindset, and many others. From the power of visualization and the importance of relaxation to the art of learning through experience, there's much more to explore within its pages. I invite you to dive into "The Inner Game of Tennis" and discover the transformative potential of its teachings firsthand. And if you're inspired to delve deeper or discuss further, don't hesitate to reach out. Together, let's continue the conversation and unlock the secrets to mastering the inner game, both on and off the court.

          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
            August 2, was the second day of the month but the first day of the month’s work week. It was also the first day of the job for soon to be DHL Supply Chain legend Shahzad Merchant. Shahzad claims to have only been in the United States of America, “the states” as some call it, for two years, first arriving when he began his master degree at Memphis State (otherwise known as University of Memphis). However, this is very unlikely because the first thing I remembered him saying was “Merchant… like the English word” at this moment I was very skeptical but because I am a stay in my lane you do you boo and ill do me kind of guy I brushed it off and continued to do what I usually do at work which is usually much of nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, my suspicion resumed when we spent the day off our home site and at Meguiar’s. I was suspiced when I looked over to see him staring at a scrumptious looking at their menu favorite, the Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich. This was suspicious because we were supposed to be on a conference call (I was not listening but was at least pretending to) and he was looking at his lunch menu obvious enough to try and use it to spark the conversation that he has never had a sonic sandwich. He then preceded to invite me to a bite to eat at… Chipotle… a restaurant he has already claimed to have experienced. I am thinking who sees such a beautiful chicken sandwich and decides he’d rather experience the salmon vanilla ridden Chipotle when right down the road he could have experienced a classic crispy chicken sandwich fried to perfection, a route 44 cherry limeade (half off when ordered on the app), and chili cheese fries because I am not a huge tot guy. All of which this order would be delivered in the most iconic fashion in the American food industry, Roller Bladed car hops.  This was only one of many strikes Mr. Shahzad received, the first was calling a picture of me taken three weeks ago fat and double downing on it multiple times as a way to gaslight me into thinking it was a compliment of how much better I look 3 weeks later. The most recent is him informing me Marshmallow’s are apparently pork which I find a hard time believing even though his extensive research seems to check out.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the point of this factual evidence based 100% true scholary publicized article both reviewed, confirmed, and approved by Phoenix University, Go fighting phoenixes!, which is to give Shahzad a detailed-ish, depending on how I feel as I write, breakdown of must have restaurants in a decent distance from DHL Supply Chain and Logistics Goody’s site so that he can choose which one we should go to.
          </p>
          <p>
            CRACKER BARREL OLD COUNTRY STORE
          </p>
          <p>
            The not so hidden gem of America has to be number one on the list. During Shahzad’s and I’s infamous trip to Meguiar’s I told him that something I recently had was so good that I almost slapped my momma. He looked at me appalled by the disrespect. However, I explained how a Southern Man prides few things over his respect and love for his mother. Which is why often when something is so delicious it is common to use the expression that it is so good that you cold slap your momma or grandmother because of how disrespectfully good it is or how good it is you almost lost your mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Cracker Barrel you will find an extensive menu from all day breakfast, to fried chicken, to steak, and everything in between. Greeted with a fresh basket of biscuits, cornbread, and a “nice to meet y’all” from the sweetest southern staff you can find it is surely to live up to the hype!
          </p>
          <p>
            This southern cooking will not disappoint and is a staple of America!
            CHILI’S GRILL
          </p>
          <p>
            Chili’s has long been known as one of the world’s finest culinary experiences. It is truly no lie that Chili’s has always been great since the founding on March 13, 1975. However, Chili’s was recently propelled to excellence from Scranton legend Pam when he “felt God in this Chili’s.” Since this moment Chili’s has won countless awards and hosted many Dundee award shows. What sets chili’s apart from everywhere else is not just the magic that brings people together and tears down barriers and bad thoughts but instead is the ultimately diverse menu and the amazing deals. Truly a class act way to ball on a budget, Chili’s offers multiple options such as the 3 for 10 which allows you to order a beverage (which at most restaurants is like 3 dollars), an appetizer, and an entrée all for the amazing price of 10 dollars. And not only do they have this amazing deal but the menu options are limitless!! There are wings, burgers, the worlds best eggrolls, chicken, and so much more! Not to forget the drink option is not just sodas and water but amazing teas with awesome flavors.
          </p>
          <p>
            We briefly mentioned the magic ability chili’s has to bring others together but we definitely need to highlight what this magic is. It is much much more than the atmosphere that secretes love for others but the trademark 2 for 25 which says come and be one. This 2 for 25 is when two people come together in friendship sharing an appetizer and dessert but still get their personal entrée! All for the amazing price of 25 dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
            COOKOUT
          </p>
          <p>
            I cannot say enough about Cookout… truly I could write the longest book in the world just about cookout. Not only because of how amazing it is but because of how extensive the menu truly is! The sign says fresh burgers, bbq, hot dogs, and shakes but they are not doing themselves justice because they are much more than that. They truly have the worlds best chicken quesadilla and their service is second to none! Always ready to serve fresh food instantly it is almost as if they are your personal chef reading your mind before you even order! You may say wow! Such an amazing place but how is it affordable for anyone! Well they have reinvented the way anyone operates because for 5.99 you can get a drink, a main dish, and two sides! And for sides go ahead and make it another main dish cause it can be a quesadilla or chicken nuggets! They have also won awards for the best every home sauce! You may say you don’t want a drink… well that is okay! Because you can upgrade that drink to one of their over 40 flavors of milkshakes for one dollar!!
          </p>
          <p>
            They may call North Carolina home but their home away from home will always be my heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            WAFFLE HOUSE
          </p>
          <p>
            Honestly if you have not been to waffle house yet then idk why I am writing this… I feel like I am not the one to write a review that can capture what Waffle House means to America… So, if you have yet to try this deliciousness, do not take my word for it. I will forward you to Robert Owen Brown of Hernando, Mississippi to explain what you have missed out on

        <!-- Ten Pints to Slytherin -->
        <section class="blog-post">
          <h2><a href="https://swchavez.wordpress.com/2021/08/24/10-pints-to-slytherin/">Ten Pints to Slytherin</a></h2>
          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
            The other day, I achieved what might be the greatest accomplishment of my life. I finally finished the last Harry Potter book. I began this journey while working in West Virginia right before the Coronavirus Pandemic began. Though I began this journey very late in my life, I have always considered myself a huge Potter head.
            </p>
          <p>
While reading the books, I realized that I have not always been a Harry Potter fan. In middle school, my friends and I played Harry Potter Scene It. I was embarrassed when I could not even answer the question, “Who is the Author?” I sort of always considered the kids who read Harry Potter as the smart ones in the spotlight and read often. It could have been that I started to love Harry Potter so much because I thought it would make others think I was part of that smart crowd! It could have even been that every year for Homecoming, a friend and I would find the closest day that could pass for Wizard theme, and we went as Harry and Hermione. Honestly, I loved Harry Potter because of how fun it was to dive into the magic! Even as a self-proclaimed Slytherin, I loved the story and everything that came with JK’s wizarding world.
</p>
<p>
In my sophomore year of college, Ole Miss played FSU in Orlando. I still remember that devastating loss Ole Miss suffered to open up the second darkest time in my Ole Miss fandom, right after the best few years I have ever experienced in sports. However, that trip was one of the best ever because of the pure excitement I felt walking through Universal Studio’s Harry Potter World. I enjoyed a Butter Beer at the Leaky Cauldron, and I will never forget when the dragon on top of Gringotts breathed fire. It truly was such a fantastic moment, but the issue was that I still had never read the books.
</p>
<p>
Reading through the books was one of the most fun I have ever had. At times I would go multiple days not reading, but then at other points, I would be completely hooked, only looking forward to picking up the book again. I even chose reading the book over studying for my master’s courses or ignoring my job duties for my new job. Overall, I think the book even helped me learn a few lessons at a point when I really needed them. The more apparent themes in the book would be love and friendship, how both love and friendship is the most powerful form of magic and luckily a form of magic that we muggles get to wield every day. However, it was the last few chapters are the ones that hit the hardest. It was the end of the book when Harry marched to his death, reunited with his loved ones, and looked a certain uncertainty in the face. I remember reading a few of the pages multiple times and even just sitting to reflect at multiple times.
</p>
<p>
Now for the hot take that I know everyone will hate.. I may be the only person to ever admit to having this opinion, but… the movies are better than the books! If Harry Potter has taught me anything, it’s that it is entirely okay to have that opinion and the ultimate ultimate lesson is not to let others say you are crazy and to gaslight you! I could write pages upon pages about how much I love the movies. The books were good, but nothing will ever beat watching the films for the first time and seeing the magic with my eyes!
